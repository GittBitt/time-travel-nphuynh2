I am learning Git version control. This is for lab 2.

The .gitignore contains /.idea, an IntelliJ folder containing project-specific 
sensitive data connected to my local machine, which I don't want to commit to the repo.

## Branches
author/idea-sprint is for the author for a new idea feature.
editor/review is for the editor to review.
